SVM Classifier on Breast Cancer Dataset-

1) Imported and preprocessed the dataset by encoding the target column and selecting two key features for 2D visualization.
 
2) Detected and removed outliers using Z-score method and visualized distributions with boxplots.
 
3) Normalized the features using StandardScaler to improve SVM performance and distance-based decisions.
 
4) Trained SVM models with both linear and RBF kernels to compare classification performance.
 
5) Tuned hyperparameters (C, gamma) using GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation to find the best model.

6) Visualized decision boundaries and evaluated the final model using cross-validation accuracy and classification metrics.
