Loaded and preprocessed the dataset (heart.csv), selecting features and the target column (target) for binary classification.

Trained a Decision Tree Classifier, visualized the tree structure using plot_tree, and evaluated accuracy on test data.

Analyzed overfitting by plotting both Train and Test accuracy vs max_depth, showing how deeper trees can lead to overfitting.

Trained a Random Forest Classifier and compared its performance to the Decision Tree; observed higher stability and generalization.

Plotted feature importances from the Random Forest to identify the most influential variables contributing to heart disease prediction.

Evaluated both models using cross-validation, ensuring robustness and consistency in accuracy beyond a single train-test split.
